## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-tracking-paint.git
   cd hand-tracking-paint
   ```
2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - **OpenCV, Numpy, and MediaPipe**:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
     ```

3. **MediaPipe Setup Issue**:
   Many users face issues with MediaPipe installation. If you encounter errors, consider using Python 3.8.10 as it is highly compatible. Here’s how:
   - Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
   - In the search bar, look for *3.8.10* and click on **Release – Python 3.8.10**.
   - Download the version for your system (e.g., **Windows installer (64-bit)**), install, and restart your computer.
   
4. **Prepare Header Images**: Make sure there’s a `Header` folder in your project directory containing toolbar images for colors and erasing.

## 🚀 How to Use  

1. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python hand_tracking_paint.py
   ```
2. **Control with Gestures**:
   - **Index Finger**: Draw lines and shapes.
   - **Index + Middle Finger**: Choose colors from the toolbar.
   - **Closed Hand**: Clear the canvas.
   - **Pinch (Index + Thumb)**: Adjust brush thickness by changing the distance between fingers.
